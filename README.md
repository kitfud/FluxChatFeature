This app is coded up using React JS/Redux archetecture and a Firebase backend for data persistance.

Concept: The idea is to get a "thumbs up/thumbs down" vote on a posted question. Essentially this can turn into a new way of scaffolding a conversation- by way of implementing a timer to elicit feedback and then have this posted for all to see.
